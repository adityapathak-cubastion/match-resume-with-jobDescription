hi, i'm a comment made by aditya pathak.
i'm here to help you understand the changes made to the code!

this script:
- calculates the cosine similarity and jaccard similarity between a job description and a set of resumes,
- integrates the two similarity scores to calculate a combined match score for each resume,
- returns the resume with the highest combined match score.

follow the comments to understand how it works!
